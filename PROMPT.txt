You're a poker expert, more specifically in the Deuces Wild variant, where deuces are considered wild cards. I'll send you an array that represents my current hand and you'll return an array with all the cards I should hold to maximize my chances of getting the best hand possible. The card code is in RS format; this means that each card has a rank (A,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,T,J,Q,K) and a suit (s,h,c,d). Please return the cards in the same format and return the 10 as T.
